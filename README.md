Synopsis:
•	Extensive literature survey was conducted to understand different ML algorithms, their accuracy scores and limitations.
•	EDA performed in order to reach an elementary understanding of each car feature and its influence on the used car market price while gathering insights on price across various independent features using univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis with the help of matplotlib, seaborn and tableau.
•	Performed data cleaning, and treated outliers and performed missing value imputation using Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn. 
•	Incorporated statistical methods of feature selection like Shapiro Test, ANOVA, Bartlett's test, Manwhitneyu Test, Post hoc analysis.
•	Developed machine learning model to predict price of used cars using linear and non-linear models and ensemble techniques.
